      'Our trip to Almaty was amazing! We flew from Vienna with a stopover in Istanbul, and everything went smoothly. We stayed at City+3 Hotel, which was comfortable and family-friendly. The best part was visiting Kok-Tobe Hill—the cable car ride was so fun, and the views of the city were breathtaking. The kids especially enjoyed the mini-zoo. Highly recommend it for a family trip!',
